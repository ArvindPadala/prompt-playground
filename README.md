## ðŸš€ Project Title
Prompt Engineering Playground: Experiment, Compare & Learn

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Description
The Prompt Engineering Playground is an interactive web app that allows you to experiment with prompt design, decoding strategies, and model behavior of modern Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-3.5, Mistral, and Gemma.

You can input a prompt, tweak temperature, top-k, top-p parameters, and instantly compare how different models respondâ€”helping you build an intuition about how prompts & parameters shape the output.

## ðŸŒŸ Key Features
Prompt Input â€“ Write your own prompt
Model Selection â€“ Choose from OpenAI GPT-3.5, Mistral-7B, Gemma
Decoding Controls â€“ Adjust temperature, top-k, and top-p
Output Comparison â€“ See side-by-side results


## ðŸ”§ Tech Stack
Python
Streamlit
Hugging Face Transformers
Local LLMs (Mistrel, Gemma, Ollama)

## ðŸ“ˆ Future Enhancements
Save prompt history
Token usage stats
User feedback option ("Which output was better?")
Prompt templates

## ðŸ™Œ Learning Outcomes
By building this, youâ€™ll master:

Prompt design principles
Model decoding behavior
How different LLMs behave
Streamlit app building
